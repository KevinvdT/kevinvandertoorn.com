# Git Commit Message Generation

When generating git commit messages, follow these principles:

## State Facts, Not Assumptions

- Describe what was changed, and why only if the reason is known or obvious
- Use concrete, observable changes (e.g., "Add user authentication form" not "Improve user experience")
- Focus on the actual modifications made to files and code

## Avoid Speculation

- Do not infer the developer's intent or reasoning unless it's explicitly obvious from the changes
- Do not add explanatory context that isn't directly visible in the diff
- Do not assume business logic or user-facing impact unless clearly evident

## Use Clear, Concise Language

- Start with a verb in imperative mood (Add, Fix, Update, Remove, etc.)
- Keep the subject line under 50 characters when possible
- Be specific about what was modified (file names, function names, features)
- Use scope prefixes when helpful: feat:, fix:, refactor:, docs:, style:, test:, chore:

## Common Change Types

- **New features**: "Add user profile editing"
- **Bug fixes**: "Fix memory leak in data processing"
- **Refactoring**: "Refactor authentication middleware"
- **Dependencies**: "Update React to v18.2.0"
- **Configuration**: "Add ESLint rules for TypeScript"
- **Documentation**: "Update API documentation"

## Breaking Changes

- Use "BREAKING CHANGE:" in the body for breaking changes
- Example: "feat: change API response format\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: user object now includes 'id' field"

## Examples

**Good:**
- "Add login form validation"
- "Fix responsive layout in mobile view"
- "Update package.json dependencies"
- "Remove unused CSS classes"
- "feat: add dark mode toggle"
- "fix: resolve memory leak in image processing"

**Avoid:**
- "Improve user experience by adding validation" (assumes intent)
- "Fix bug that was causing issues" (vague, assumes problem)
- "Update code for better performance" (assumes optimization intent)
- "WIP" or "temp" (too vague)
- "Fix stuff" (not descriptive)
